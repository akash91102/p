Are there any minimum and maximum length validations for SPN and ECID? If so, what are the specific limits?

I'm calling the ref-data/search API to validate the Legal Entity ID. Although I receive a response, how can I determine whether it's a valid Legal Entity ID?

From where should I populate the Cross Product Margin Calculation details such as tier, tier version, and add-on? These values are not available in the current API response.

Could you please share a sample request object for the submit API that is considered valid? I’m unable to save the data as I’m unsure about the exact payload format that needs to be sent.
